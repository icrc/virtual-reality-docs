# Video Pathway

?> A system for building projects based around videos and user choices - these could be 'choose your own adventure' style stories, interactive quizzes, or anything else you can imagine.

## Getting Started

Video Pathway is designed to be (hopefully) simple and intuitive, and this documentation will guide you through everything you need to know in order to use it effectively. If you want to jump straight in and start building, then we suggest following the 'Quick Start' below, but if you prefer reading all about the system first in order to understand it better - then jumping to the learning section is recommended.

### Quick Start

To get going right now, you can:

* [Click here to start a new project]({{vpBaseURL}}edit/new) - optionally building on top of a template. Or...
* [Load an existing project]({{vpBaseURL}}edit/load) - open an existing project and start from there


### Learning Video Pathway

For a more detailed understanding of how to build your Video Pathway projects, we suggest reading through the following:

* [Core concepts](concepts.md) - learn about the essential elements that make up a project
* [Edit projects](editing.md) - information on the project editor and how to best utilise it
* [Action code](actionCode.md) - learn about the simple programming language that makes things happen in your projects
* [Action reference](actionReference.md) - detailed information about the actions that can be carried out whilst viewing your project
